🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Raspberry Pi 4 (for edge deployment)

Basic understanding of IoT devices

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Ayushkr-ittm/AgriSakha_Prototype.git
cd AgriSakha_Prototype

Set up the voice AI module:
cd voice_ai
pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure environment variables:
cp config.example.py config.py
# Edit config.py with your settings

Run basic tests:
python -m pytest tests/test_voice_ai.py
For detailed installation instructions, see INSTALL.md.

🎯 Demonstration Scenarios
Voice-Based Advisory
Farmer calls the system and speaks in local dialect: "मेरी फसल में पीले पड़ रहे हैं"

System analyzes query using IndicWhisper ASR

AI provides localized remedy: "नीम का तेल 5ml प्रति लीटर पानी में मिलाकर छिड़काव करें"

Credit Scoring
System automatically analyzes satellite data of farmer's field

Checks UPI transaction history from mandi sales

Generates blockchain-based credit score with voice explanation

Voice Commerce
Buyer submits voice bid: "100kg tomatoes @₹45 today"

AI matches with farmer collectives based on proximity and quality

Transaction recorded on blockchain for transparency
